# A ball factory that creates balls which move under gravity.  

## *Description* : This will create any number of balls and then bounce them within a defined area while taking gravity into consideration.

### *Usage*: 
1. Open the file then the IDE 
2. Enter the number of balls you'd like to simulate as arguments in the function factory. 
	* For example for 15 balls the input should be: factory(15)
3. It is also possible to update the balls velocity, to do that type: update()

### *Roadmap*
Next version will simulate the movement of Covid-19 particles after sneezing while taking gravity into consideration.

### *Licene*
